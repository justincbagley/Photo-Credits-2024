## "Incidence and effects of anomalies and hybridization on Alabama fish index of biotic integrity results"

Talk on recent research I conducted with colleagues at ADEM looking at the incidence and effects of external anomalies and hybridization on Alabama fish IBI outcomes. I presented the corresponding talk at the Southeastern Water Pollution Biologists Association (SWPBA) 2024 Meeting in Louisville, KY, on October 22, 2024.
